## Project Concept

### What are you building?

A responsive and accessible personal portfolio website designed to present my work as a UX/UI and web designer.
The site includes a main landing page with animated sections, a projects showcase, a contact area, a custom 404 error page, and structured documentation of the design and development process.

The project is built with semantic HTML, a modular CSS architecture, Bootstrap 5, and purposeful GSAP animations to enhance usability without compromising performance or accessibility.

### Who is it for?

The primary audience is potential employers and collaborators looking to evaluate my design thinking, front-end skills, and attention to detail.
A secondary audience includes other designers and developers interested in learning from a well-documented, accessibility-conscious portfolio project.

### Why does it matter?

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my ability to:

- Translate design decisions into clean, maintainable front-end code
- Build responsive layouts following a mobile-first approach
- Implement animations with clear purpose and respect for accessibility preferences
- Maintain a structured workflow through sprint planning and documentation
- It reflects not only the final visual outcome, but also the process, reasoning, and technical decisions behind the work.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

Minimalist and modern, with a strong focus on readability, hierarchy, and clarity.  
The design relies on a neutral color palette, generous spacing, and a fluid typographic system to ensure consistency across devices.

Subtle, purposeful animations are used to guide attention and enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content.

### Color Palette

- Primary Black: #000000
  Main dark background and primary text color in dark sections.

- Primary White: #ffffff
  Text and background color for light sections (e.g. 404 page).

- Primary Accent (Indigo): #6366f1
  Primary buttons, links, and interactive elements.

- Dark 70: #666666
  Secondary text and muted UI elements.

- Dark 50: #969696
  Supporting text and low-emphasis content.

- Grey 30: #cccccc
  Borders, dividers, and subtle UI elements.

- Grey 20: #e3e3e3
  Light backgrounds and separators.

- Grey 5: #f0f0f0
  Card backgrounds and elevated surfaces.

### Typography

- Headings: System sans-serif or Google Font (e.g., Inter)
- Body: System sans-serif for readability

## Reflection Questions

### What excites you most about this project?

What excites me most is turning a design-focused portfolio into a fully functional, documented, and accessible web project. Beyond the visual result, I’m proud of having built a structured system: a clear CSS architecture, multiple development sprints, thoughtful animations with purpose, and a custom 404 page. Seeing everything work cohesively across devices and with accessibility in mind makes the project feel complete and professional.

### What challenges do you anticipate?

One of the main challenges was balancing visual richness with performance and accessibility, especially when working with animations and floating background elements. Ensuring smooth motion without overwhelming the user, preventing layout shifts on mobile, and avoiding interaction issues (such as layered elements blocking buttons) required careful testing and iteration. Maintaining consistency across pages while keeping the codebase clean and scalable was also a key challenge.

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?

This project directly applies the core concepts of Web Design 2025 in a real-world context. I worked with semantic HTML, a scalable CSS architecture using custom properties, responsive layouts with Bootstrap, and purposeful GSAP animations enhanced by ScrollTrigger. It also strengthened my focus on accessibility, documentation, and iterative development through clearly defined sprints, aligning perfectly with my goal of building professional, production-ready web experiences.
